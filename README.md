# ZebraFTShows

Well since I'm also a passionate flow artist and since I have some wonderful programmable Zebra FT Pois from Pyroterra Lighttoys, why not use this tool to manage the shows I'll write for them?

I don't know for how long I'll keep this repository public, because it's quite a lot of work to:
- choose a song that vibrates with you
- break down to the millisecond the parts of the song where you want to change the light patterns
- determine what moves would look best on each part of the song (aka plan the choreography)
- imagine what light patterns would have the most WOW effect on the part of the song and choreography
- and then actually implement the show
- test the show over and over, tweak, change, remove, etc.

I consider that all of this work backed up by my artistic vision results in something wonderfully unique, and thus, at one point, I'll make you come and see me live perform and not just hand out everything. 

Or maybe not. I haven't decided yet. 

But until then, since I'm only beginning with the custom light shows, you can find inspiration in what I did so far. Feel free to use them as you wish. 

And if someone actually stumbles over this repo and knows what I'm talking about, I would really appreciate to hear your feedback or if you have other show examples to share!

May the flow guide you to great performances!
